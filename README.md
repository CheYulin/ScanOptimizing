# pScan Optimizing

Project: pScan (Graph Clustering) Optimization

## My Work

### Understanding and Works

* pScan: extension of spatial dbScan to graph, in order to explore structural clusters, current research focus on **unweighted, undirected not dynamic** graph.

* two parameters: **density threshold**, **min number of neighbors**, input graph representation: csr representation.

* density function: `number of common neighbors` / `(sqrt(du * dv))`

* pScan basic concepts:
  * introduce `similar_degree`, `effective_degree` to help checking core, if a vertex is a core iff `sd <= number of reachable neighbors <=ed`, which can be used as a pruning rule,
  * introduce `min_cn`, alternative values: reachable, not_reachable, min_cn for guaranteeing a core

* runing:
  * pre-processing, `PruneAndCrossLink`, prune not reachable `if (((long long) a) * eps_b2 < ((long long) b) * eps_a2)`, which is easy to deduced when the max of`number of common neighbors` is `min(du,dv)`, and utilize cross-link
  * `common neighbor lower bound <=2`, must be similar, self and neighbor vertices
  * compute common neighbor with early exit, via utilizing `sd` and `ed`
  * other tricks to reduce the number of evaluations of reachability

### Package Organization

pSCAN package further usage must follow [GPLv3 license](pSCAN-refactor/LICENSE).

* pSCAN-fork-optimization implementations follow modern cpp rules, to make things easier without loss of performance.

### Profiling

see [run_pscan_gperftools.sh](pSCAN-refactor/run_pscan_gperftools.sh), [run_pscan_perf.sh](pSCAN-refactor/run_pscan_perf.sh), [run_pscan_valgrind.sh](pSCAN-refactor/run_pscan_valgrind.sh) and this post [profiler tutorial](http://gernotklingler.com/blog/gprof-valgrind-gperftools-evaluation-tools-application-level-cpu-profiling-linux/).

**set-intersection** is the bottleneck in the current pScan design.

# ppSCAN

Parallel pSCAN algorithm with vectorized set intersection, compared with SCAN, pSCAN, SCAN++, anySCAN, SCAN-XP (an order of magnitude faster than the-state-of-the-arts), 250x faster than pSCAN on KNL (1.8 billion-edge-grap friendster). Please check out our ICPP'18 paper for further details. (ppSCAN is tested on both Multi-core Intel Xeon CPU and Intel Xeon Phi Processor Knights Landing)

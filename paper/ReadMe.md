## Comments

* Problem: related work should be put after preliminaries, otherwise it may be weird

done, by placing it right after notations and SCAN algorithm

* in technique section, emphasize my contributions(set-intersection improvement),
separate existing work(1. similarity predicate eval:
easy computation pruning/better set-intersection

done, by summarizing my three contributions at the beginning of techniques, the first one

* in technique section 2. core checking and clustering: avoiding redundant computation
and min-max and disjoint-set pruning) and
my contributions(set-intersection improvement and non-trivial parallel extension)

done, by summarizing my three contributions at the beginning of techniques, the second and third, my observations and parallel extension analysis

* related work should be put after preliminaries, otherwise it may be weird

* in technique section, emphasize my contributions(set-intersection improvement), 
separate existing work(1. similarity predicate eval: 
easy computation pruning/better set-intersection
, 2. core checking and clustering: avoiding redundant computation 
and min-max and disjoint-set pruning) and 
my contributions(set-intersection improvement and non-trivial parallel extension)

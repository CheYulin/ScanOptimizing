	A common class of graph structural clustering algorithms, pioneered by
SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks), not only find
clusters among vertices but also classify vertices as cores, hubs and
outliers. However, these algorithms suffer from efficiency issues due to the
great amount of computation on structural similarity among vertices.
Pruning-based SCAN algorithms improve efficiency by reducing the
amount of computation. Nevertheless, this structural similarity computation
is still the performance bottleneck, especially on big graphs of billions
of edges. In this paper, we propose to parallelize pruning-based SCAN
algorithms on multi-core CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi Processors (KNL) with
multiple threads and vectorized instructions. Specifically, we design
ppSCAN, a multi-phase vertex computation based parallel algorithm, to avoid redundant computation and
achieve scalability. Moreover, we propose a
pivot-based vectorized set intersection algorithm for the structural
similarity computation. Experimental results show that ppSCAN is scalable
on both CPU and KNL with respect to the number of threads.
In particular, on the 1.8 billion-edge graph friendster, our ppSCAN completes within 65 seconds on KNL (64 physical cores with hyper-threading), which is 100x-130x faster over our single-threaded version, and up to 250x
faster than pSCAN, the state-of-the-art sequential algorithm.

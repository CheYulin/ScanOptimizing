	A common class of graph structural clustering algorithms, pioneered by
	SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks), not only find
	clusters among vertices but also classify vertices as cores, hubs and
	outliers. However, these algorithms suffer from efficiency issues of extensive similarity computations using set intersections. Pruning-based SCAN algorithms reduce the
	amount of computation. Nevertheless, the similarity computation
	is still the performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose to parallelize pruning-based SCAN
	algorithms on multi-core CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi Processors (KNL). Specifically, we design
	ppSCAN, a multi-phase vertex computation based parallel algorithm. Moreover, we propose a pivot-based vectorized set intersection algorithm.
	Experimental results show that ppSCAN is scalable on both
	CPU and KNL with respect to the number of threads.
	In particular, on the 1.8 billion-edge graph friendster, our ppSCAN
	achieves speedups of 100x-130x on KNL (64 physical cores with hyper-threading) and the in-memory computation completes within 65 seconds, up to 250x
	faster than pSCAN, the state-of-the-art sequential algorithm.
